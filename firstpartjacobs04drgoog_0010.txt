The following extr-acts from the preface to the first edi-
tion will sufficiently explain the manner in which the
Reader was originally prepared by its present editor.

Three things were found to clair'n particular attention, in
preparing a new edition of this work. The first was the ar·
rangement .0f the Introductory Lessons, so as best to illus-

is prefaced by a serie.- of questions relating to those parts
of the Grammar intended to be illustrated.

In the notes appended to this edition, the editor has
carried into effect a design‚ which he had long since
formed, of explaining the idioms of the language, in intro-

He has hoped, by this means, to aid the student in forming
a clear, connected, and consistent view of the idiomatic
peculiarities of the language, and a habit of referring every
difficulty, whether in form or construction, to its appropriate
place in the Grammar. It is a matter of common observa-
tion, tuat, to most studente, the philological notes usually
