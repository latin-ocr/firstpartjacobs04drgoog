PREFACE.

 

Tne Latin Reader, a new edition of which is here pre-
sented to the public, was originally prepared by its present
editor, as the first of a series of elementary works adapted
to the Grammar of Andrews and Stoddard. This series
now eompriSeS, in addition to the Grammar above men-
tioned, Questions on the Grammar, Latin Lessons, The
Latin Reader, Latin Exereises, Α Key to Latin Exercises,
Viri Romae, Caesar's Commentarios on the Gallie War,
Sallust, and Seleetions from Ovid. In the present edition,
the adaptation of this work to the Grammar, and to its
place in the series above enumerated,remains unaltered;
b'ut, in addition to its original design, the Reader is now
intended to constitute the second part of a less extended
serieS, comprising the editor’s First Latin Book, the Latin
Reader, and the Viri Romoe. The latter series is designed
especially for those who commenee the study of Latin at a
very early age, and also for such. as intend to pursue the
same study to a limited extent only, or merely as a part of
general education.

The references at the foot o‘ the pages relate to the
sections and subordinate divisione of Andrews and Stod-
dard's Latin Grammar: The references to Andrews’ First
Latin Book may be found at the close of the volume. The
marles of· reference in the text refer both to the notes at the
foot of the page and to those at the end of the book. 111
the latter series, indeed, other notes are oeeasioually added,
and their place is denoted by quoting the words of the text
to which such notes relate.
